Located at the heart of Paris,\nthis medieval cathedral is 21 for its intricate architecture, stunning stained glass windows, and, above\nall, its bells.\nMounted in the two tall towers of the cathedral, Notre-Dame’s bells have been ringing for over 800\nyears. In fact, there is documented 22 to the ringing of bells even before the cathedral’s construction\nwas completed, dating as far back as the 12th century. The 10 bells vary in size, each 23 a name. The\nlargest one, named “Emmanuel,” weighs over 13 tons. It is the only one of the whole group that 24 the\nFrench Revolution, while the rest were melted down for weapons. The melted bells were recast in the late\n19th century. But due to their poor acoustic quality, all of the bells were replaced in 2013—except for\nEmmanuel, which 25 its renowned, excellent sound. This particular bell, ringing in F sharp, is\nconsidered one of the most harmonically beautiful in Europe.\nOver centuries, the bells have become a 26 part of life in Paris, where they are known as “the\ncathedral’s voice.” They have been used to mark the hours of the day, to call the 27 to prayer, and to\nsignal emergency situations such as fires and invasions. They have also rung in times of 28 and of\nmourning, announcing such events as royal weddings and coronations of kings, as well as funerals of heads\nof state.\nHowever, after the devastating fire that damaged the cathedral in 2019, the bells fell 29 . The\nbuilding went through a complex and time-consuming process of 30 , and the famous monument was\nfinally reopened on December 8, 2024. The sounds of Notre-Dame bells once again filled the air in Paris,\nand will be heard for generations to come.\n(A) reference (B) bearing (C) familiar (D) retained (E) faithful\n(F) survived (G) celebration (H) restoration ( I ) noted (J) silent",

    "text": "On a hilltop overlooking the 2011-tsunami hit Otsuchi Town in northeastern Japan, there is a white\nphone booth standing all alone in the wind. The lonely “wind phone” serves to connect family members to\ntheir 21 loved ones who died in the tsunami that claimed 18,000 lives. People come to speak to those\nthey have lost, to say the words they never got to say on that 22 day.\nThe idea for the wind phone was first 23 by a Japanese garden designer named Itaru Sasaki,\nwho was grieving over the death of his cousin in 2010, before the tsunami. Feeling that he needed a private\nspace to help him navigate through the 24 , Sasaki positioned a booth where he could “speak” to the\ndead relative. The booth he built 25 only an old dial phone with a disconnected phone line. When he\nstepped into the booth, he could pick up the phone to call his cousin, telling him how he was, and how he\nmissed him. Sasaki stated in an interview: “Because my thoughts couldn’t be 26 through a regular\nphone line, I wanted them to be carried on the wind.” Hence, the wind phone allows Sasaki to create a oneway conversation with deep, soulful personal meaning, and renders the grieving process more 27 for\nhim.\nSasaki opened his wind phone to the public in 2011, after the devastating tsunami. News about the\nphone gradually spread, and the booth has become a 28 between the living and the dead. Phones\nresembling the wind phone have since been built around the world. Some were even set up to allow people\nto call their loved ones lost in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGrieving is a natural 29 for coping with loss of a loved one, and people grieve in various ways.\nFor those who speak into the wind phone, 30 is always there: They believe that their messages will—\nthrough some unknown way—reach the deceased.\n(A) passed on (B) bridge (C) sorrow (D) hope (E) departed\n(F) mechanism (G) housed (H) manageable (I) fateful (J) brought forth",

    "text": "Water makes up more than half of our body weight. To sustain this amount of fluid in our bodies, plain\nwater is considered our best choice, for it contains no sugar and no calories. Yet, is water always the\nhealthiest drink we can 21 ? Well, it depends on who and where we are, and what we’re doing.\nObviously, a physically 22 person with an outdoor job under the sun will need to drink more\nfluid than a desk-bound person who lives and works in an air-conditioned place. But there’s more to it than\nthat. When a person sweats, he loses water and salt, so he needs to replace both. Replacing lost fluid with\njust plain water means the body has too much water and not enough salt. To 23 things out, the body\nwill get rid of water by producing urine. For this reason, milk can actually be more 24 than drinking\nwater. Milk naturally contains salt and lactose, a sugar which the human body needs in small amounts to\nhelp stimulate water 25 . Coconut water, which contains salt and carbohydrates, is also more\nfunctional than water at restoring and maintaining a normal fluid 26 after exercise.\nFor the average person, however, water remains a very good 27 for keeping hydrated—if you\nknow how to drink it. The secret is: Never wait until the body is telling you you’re thirsty, since there must\nalready have been significant changes in your body for it to eventually 28 your consciousness. At\nthat point, it might be well past the best moment to take in fluid. Also, drinking a lot of liquid in one go can\ncause more water to 29 the body quickly and come out as urine. To 30 this, you need to drink\nwater throughout the day to maintain your hydration levels.\n(A) absorption (B) active (C) alert (D) combat (E) option\n(F) effective (G) even (H) status (I) pass through (J) reach for",

This story may\nsound highly credible, but there seems to be no solid evidence that it inspired the creation of the 35 we\nknow of today as fortune cookies.\nAnother 36 claims that David Jung, a Chinese immigrant living in Los Angeles, created the\nfortune cookie in 1918. Concerned about the poor people he saw wandering near his shop, he made cookies\nand passed them out free on the streets. Each cookie 37 a strip of paper inside with an inspirational\nBible quotation on it.\nHowever, the more generally accepted story is that the fortune cookie first 38 in either 1907 or\n1914 in San Francisco, created by a Japanese immigrant, Makoto Hagiwara. The fortune cookie was based\non a Japanese snack, but Hagiwara sweetened the recipe to appeal to American 39 . He enclosed thankyou notes in the cookies and served them to his guests with tea.

The land was so 35 that it had to be watered several times a day.\nKareem had to fetch the water from a source that was a kilometer away. In the first two years, none of\nthe trees he planted 36 . However, in the third year, several young trees started growing.

But where did this simple,\ncheap, and indispensable invention come from?\nIn the late 19th century, the most common way to hold papers together was by using a pin. Although\nthe pin was an inexpensive tool and was easily 32 , it would leave holes in the paper. Later, as steel\nwire became more common, inventors began to notice its elastic feature. With this feature, it could be\nstretched and 33 various clip-like objects. In the years just prior to 1900, quite a few paperclip\ndesigns emerged. The name most frequently 34 the paperclip invention is Johan Vaaler, a\nNorwegian inventor. However, Vaaler’s clips were not the same as the paperclips currently in use.\nSpecifically, they did not have the interior loop we see today. The 35 looped design was invented\nby Gem Manufacturing Ltd. in England. This clip is therefore sometimes 36 the Gem clip.\nBecause of Vaaler, the paperclip played an important 37 role in Norway. During World War II,\nNorway was occupied by the Nazis. Norwegians were prohibited from wearing any 38 of their\nnational unity, such as buttons with the initials of their king. Thus, in 39 , they started wearing\npaperclips to show their solidarity. The reason for doing this was simple: Paperclips were a Norwegian\ninvention whose original function was to bind together.

Following the number-based convention, typhoons are coded with 31 types of numbers\nsuch as a 4-digit or a 6-digit code. For example, the 14th typhoon in 2003 can be labeled either as\nTyphoon 0314 or Typhoon 200314. The 32 of this convention, however, is that a number is hard to\nremember. The list-based convention, on the other hand, is based on the list of typhoon names compiled\nin advance by a committee, and is more widely used.\nAt the very beginning, only 33 names were used because at that time typhoons were named\nafter girlfriends or wives of the experts on the committee. In 1979, however, male names were also\nincluded because women protested against the original naming 34 for reasons of gender equality.\nIn Asia, Western names were used until 2000 when the committee decided to use Asian names to\n 35 Asians’ awareness of typhoons. The names were chosen from a name pool 36 of 140\nnames, 10 each from the 14 members of the committee. Each country has its unique naming preferences.\nKorea and Japan 37 animal names and China likes names of gods such as Longwang (dragon king)\nand Fengshen (god of the wind).\nAfter the 140 names are all used in order, they will be 38 . But the names can be changed. If a\nmember country suffers great damage from a certain typhoon, it can 39 that the name of the\ntyphoon be deleted from the list at the annual committee meeting.
